## v1.0.1 - Rich validate docs
Documented module/validate exports, usage, and configuration so `validate` and related docs stay front and center. The new README copy together with the docs site highlight the module quickly for adoptive searches.

### Added
- Added a `docs/index.html` technical reference with exports, usage, configuration, and examples that link to instago.ai.
- Expanded `ReadMe.MD` to describe the module, exports, usage, and examples alongside the new marketing copy.

### Changed
- Updated `test.js` (and README / docs references) to load `validate@latest` and keep examples consistent with the published package.
